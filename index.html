        <span>Legicyle is a data-based database project which takes a prospective bill and compares it to every unpassed bill that's gone through the United States Congress or Senate in the last 50 years and checks for similar clauses. This allows us to identify clauses which have been suggested before but never made it into law, and have now been successful.  </span>

      <div class="headline">How does Legicycle Work?</div>
      <div class="content">
      </div>
      <span>Using 21st century data science techniques, Legicyle identifies the subject matter of a bill and prepares to compare it to thousands of other bills with the same or similar subject matter. Once the subject is identified, the bill is split into clauses, and each clause is checked against every clause in every other bill using string analysis methods. Each old clause is given a similarity rating relative to the original clause. Old clauses with a sufficiently high rating are included in the search results.</span>
